## Mapping Formula
If you have a 3D array   **Original[HEIGHT, WIDTH, DEPTH]**   then you could turn it into   **Flat[HEIGHT * WIDTH * DEPTH]**   1D array by

```Flat[x + HEIGHT * (y + WIDTH * z)] = Original[x, y, z], assuming Original[HEIGHT,WIDTH,DEPTH]```

To study more about this, refer to following links:
